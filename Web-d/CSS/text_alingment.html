    <h1>Fish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>

        Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> animals that lack limbs
        with digits. They form
        a sister group to the
        tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and
        cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Around 99% of living fish species are
        ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with over 95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping.

    The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the
    Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more
    agile
    than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into
    a
    wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators.

    The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine
    predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.
    Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures
    change,
    though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature.[1][2]

    Fish can acoustically communicate with each other, most often in the context of feeding, aggression or
    courtship.[3]
